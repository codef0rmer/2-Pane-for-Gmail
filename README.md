2 Pane For Gmail/Calendar
========================
A browser extension tuning Gmail/Calendar with 2-pane navigation. It makes more room for
mails by converting Gmail into a two-pane navigation scheme.

Overview
--------

The Gmail new [navigation bar](http://lifehacker.com/5864328/get-the-new-google-bar-now-with-a-cookie-tweak) takes a lot of vertical space and we do not often use
the search box so its very useful to toggle it at your will and use that space to
read your mails confortably. Anyone with a netbook, ultraportable, or other computing
device with low vertical resolution can testify to the nightmare of the new design changes
introduced to Gmail.

Simply install and enjoy browsing mails with 60 more pixels devoted to vertical space.
To access controls hidden in 2-Pane mode, click the icon in the addressbar.


Installation
-------------------------

Just install the extension from [the Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/m5plg).

TODO
-------------------------

* FOUC problem for hidden Navigation bar after re-sizing the browser.
